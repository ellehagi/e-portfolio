									<p>Inital Post:In table 1 of Padhy et al. (2021), the article states that various factors influence the reusability of object-oriented software components. The first component is modularity, in highly modular code, the code is usually easier to understand, test and use in other systems, this allows for components to be used independently. Cohesion in code increases reusability in the code as the classes tend to have a clear and focused purpose.
Moreover, Low coupling is generally very desirable as the components donâ€™t rely heavily on one and another and Lower complexity is regarded as good because the components are easier to adapt and understand. Well-documented code increases its reusability because it allows developers to understand the code. Further, smaller components tend to be more reusable because they are not tightly bound to very specific use cases. The proper usage of inheritance can promote reusability.
</p>
									<p>Data structures are considered very important building blocks in OOP, data structures help organise, store and manage data effectively. Data structures support key concepts like inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism. Here is a list of data structures that support OOP development.
 
Lists:
Multiple instances of class are supported by lists, it supports oop through encapsulation for example, A list can be added as a private attribute within a class.
 
class Student:
	def __init__(self, name):
    	self.name = name
 
students = [Student("Alice"), Student("Bob")]
 
for s in students:
	print(s.name)
 
 
Dictionaries:
Dictionaries support OOP by Encapsulation, this is because a class can manage its own dictionary internally. In composition objects can store nested data.
 
class Inventory:
	def __init__(self):
    	self.items = {}  # e.g., {"apple": 10, "banana": 5}
 
	def add_item(self, name, quantity):
    	self.items[name] = quantity
 
	def get_quantity(self, name):
    	return self.items.get(name, 0)
 
store = Inventory()
store.add_item("apple", 10)
print(store.get_quantity("apple"))
</p>
									<p>Unit-3:According to UML the Unified Modeling Language Reference Manual (2nd Ed.) There are a variety of diagrams that are useful at different stages of the software development cycle. Firstly, there is the requirement phase: the goal is to understand what the system does. The second phase is the design phase, this phase is focused on planning how the system is built. The implementation phase is focused on coding the systems, this includes putting design into practice. Moreover, the testing and maintenance phase involves the evolution of the system and the validating of the system.  </p>
